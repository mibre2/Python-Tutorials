# Booleans are a builtin datatype in Python.
# Boolean values: True, False

# Display boolean values
print(True)
print(False, "\n")

# Compare two numbers using booleans
# NOTICE you use one "=" to assign values, whereas you use "==" to compare them.
a = 5
b = 7
print("a =", a)
print("b =", b, "\n")

print("a == b")
print(a == b, "\n") # This comparison is False, because "a" DOES NOT equal "b".

# Another way to test is by using the "NOT equal" operator.
# NOT equal: "!="
print("a != b")
print(a != b, "\n") # This comparison is True becasue "a" DOES NOT equal "b".

# Compare logical statements using
print("a < b")
print(a < b, "\n") # This comparison is True, because "a" is less than "b".

print("a > b")
print(a > b, "\n") # This comparison is False, because "a" IS NOT greater than "b".
